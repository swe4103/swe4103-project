## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

This project follows a 2-tier **(this may change to 3-tier if we ever decide to migrate to a cloud hosted DB)** client-server architecture, where the React frontend handles the user interface and communicates with the Express backend API to manage data and server-side logic, ensuring a clear separation between the presentation and application layers.

## ‚õëÔ∏è Contributing

When making changes in this project, whether new features or bug fixes, the workflow should resemble the following.

**Note:** If you use a UI tool for git like GitHub Desktop, feel free to keep using it and loosely follow the below steps.

1. Checkout the main branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Pull the latest changest from the main branch

```bash
git pull origin main
```

3. Create your new branch that you will work on. Use `feat` for a new feature, or `fix` for a bug fix. `SCRUM-#` should correspond with the Jira ticket number you are working off of.

```bash
git checkout -b feat|fix-SCRUM-#
```

4. After you are satisfied with your changes, add the changes to your local staging area

```bash
git add <files-to-add>
```

5. Commit your changes with a short, informative commit message. Please prefix it with `feat` or `fix` like your branch name, and your Jira identifier in brackets

```bash
git commit -m "feat|fix(SCRUM-#): Example message"
```

6. Finally, push your changes to your remote branch

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

A full example is shown below for clarity:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat-SCRUM-1

... make changes ...

git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "feat(SCRUM-1): Add new text file"
git push origin feat-SCRUM-1
```

7. After you do this, you should be able to go to our repository on GitHub, and create a new Pull Request that can be reviewed by other team members and eventually merged into the main branch

8. Once you have created the Pull Request, you will notice a template is present in the description field. Please fill out this template so team members can review your PR with ease.

## üöÄ Local Run

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) and **Yarn** must be installed on your machine. You can verify if you have these by running the following commands

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
```

#### Windows

- You can download Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en)
- After installing Node.js, install Yarn by running

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### macOS

- On macOS, you can install Node.js via Homebrew

```bash
brew install node
```

- To install Yarn, also use Homebrew

```bash
brew install yarn
```

- If you do not have Homebrew on your mac, I would highly recommend installing it [here](https://brew.sh/).

### Steps

1. First, start by cloning this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swe4103/swe4103-project.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd swe4103-project
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

4. At this point, you can run either just the client (frontend React.js application), just run the server (backend Express.js API), or you can run them concurrently, communicating with eachother

**Client**

```bash
yarn client
```

Client application should be running at `http://localhost:????`

**Server (API)**

```bash
yarn api
```

API server application should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

**Both**

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will run both the client and the API server concurrently communicating with eachother in the foreground.
